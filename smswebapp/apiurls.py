API-related URLconf

"""
# DRF-YASG determines the basePath for an API by looking at the longest common prefix of *all* URLs
# in the urlconf. For pure API projects, this is fine but we also serve non-API views from
# different paths so we need to "trick" DRF-YASG into thinking the only URLs we serve are API
# related ones. Hence this module providing what would be the URLconf if this project were
# API-only. This trick means that DRF-YASG correctly sets the basePath of the swagger document to
# be "/api" and then separates all the resources out by the next component of the path.

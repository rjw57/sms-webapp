/**
 * A container component which takes a media item resource and upload endpoint via its props and
 * provides the upload flow.
 *
 * This is a somewhat complicated container in that it attempts to make sure that as much
 * interaction is possible, even before the item or upload endpoint resources are available. To
 * that end, it separates the selection of the file from the initiation of the upload. The user can
 * proceed to enter item metadata but can only publish the item when both the original item
 * resource and upload endpoint resource have been set.
 *
 * Once the user has selected a file *AND* the upload endpoint resource is truthy, the upload URL
 * is used to upload the file. We use XMLHttpRequest to upload the file so that we can give
 * progress information to the user.
 *
 * Once the upload has completed and the media item resource is truthy, the publish button is no
 * longer disabled and we "publish" the item but PUT-ing the new metadata via the API.
